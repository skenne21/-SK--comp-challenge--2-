# -SK--comp-challenge--2-


I created a desk of cards using flex box to control the card layout and  keep them inline. I contorl the display of the cards by setting the flex to flex justify content to flex-start and added a wrap feature to get the cards move under each other. 

this static was based of the simpsons.
